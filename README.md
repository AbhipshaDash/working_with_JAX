# JAX Framework Exploration Repository
This repository contains code examples and projects for exploring the JAX framework. The projects demonstrate different use cases of JAX, including solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and implementing a deep operator network (DeepONet) for learning antiderivatives from data.

## Project 1: Kuramoto-Sivashinsky Equation Solver
This project implements a solver for the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation using an Exponential Time Differencing Runge-Kutta (ETDRK2) scheme. The KS equation is a fourth-order nonlinear partial differential equation that models various physical phenomena such as flame fronts, reaction-diffusion systems, and liquid films.

## Project 2: Deep Operator Network for Antiderivatives
This project implements a deep operator network (DeepONet) to learn the antiderivative of a given function from data. The network uses Equinox for neural network definitions and Optax for optimization. The dataset used contains aligned input-output pairs for training and testing the model.
